# Basic Auth with 2FA in Node.js and Express

## Insights:
- This project has enabled me to gain a deep understanding of user authentication and authorization techniques using JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for secure communication between the client and the server.
- I have implemented 2-factor authentication (2FA) using a combination of QR codes (generated with the qrcode package) and a temporary token system, which adds an extra layer of security to the authentication process.
- The Node.js and Express framework allowed me to build a fast and scalable backend while working with various technologies to ensure a secure API.
- By integrating Nedb, a lightweight database, and Node-Cache for temporary token storage, I gained practical experience in handling session management, token-based storage, and efficient database operations.
- Through implementing crypto for generating temporary tokens, I learned about secure data handling and encryption in web applications, crucial for 2FA processes.

## Summaries:
- This project has sharpened my ability to design user interfaces and flows that not only prioritize a seamless user experience but also support high levels of security. I have learned how to balance intuitive UX design with robust security protocols to ensure that the application is both user-friendly and safe from unauthorized access.
- Furthermore, I have improved my problem-solving skills in designing security layers and understanding how authentication and authorization mechanisms work in web applications. This knowledge will help me in making informed decisions on UI/UX design that meets security best practices.
